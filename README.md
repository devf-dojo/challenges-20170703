# Challenges week 2
Some short challenges for the week of Campus Party!

You can find the details in each of the 3 other files in this repository.

There is an easy, an intermediate, and a hard problem. The first working solution submitted for each will win a prize to be determined :tada::smile:

To submit a solution, post your repo in #repositories on Slack.
